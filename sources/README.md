The `sources/` directory is for all non-data source material, such as wireframes or original images.  Some suggested directories:

* `images`
* `audio`
* `data`

Note that if these are materials that should not be made public, consider using S3 or some other similar service and make a note in the project `README.md` on where to get those.
